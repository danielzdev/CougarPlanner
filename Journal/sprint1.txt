Location: CSUSM, SE 370 Lab
Time: October 20th 2025
Attendees: Amanda, Daniel, Kenny, Quentin

Notes:
Time management was a big thing, not having concrete meeting dates made things a bit weird, so we are now
going to have meetings times set in stone beforehand.

Let my team know that things will have to change due to what I learned while managing the json. I will update
the google doc.

Requesting data from the API is a lot more involved then I initially thought.

Plan we made was a little hard to follow, so some things were conflicting in terms of naming or functionality.

Quentin is almost finished with his code, should be done within the next 2 days.
Need to have concrete meeting times, so:

Sprint 2 should be done by next monday.
Daniel will figure out how his API stuff works by Wednesday.
Sprint 2 meeting will be on monday, during or after lab.
